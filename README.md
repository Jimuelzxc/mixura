# Mixura - Your Idea Organizer

Mixura is a simple, easy-to-use website for saving and organizing pictures you find online. If you're a creative person, a designer, or just someone who likes to save inspiring images, this is for you! It's like Pinterest, but it's your own personal space. You can save image links, put them into "boards," and arrange them in different ways, even on a blank canvas.

## ‚ú® What Mixura Does

*   **Save & Sort**: Easily save picture links. Add titles, notes, tags, and even colors to keep them neat.
*   **Lots of Boards**: Make different "boards" to group your inspirations. There's also an "All Boards" view to see everything at once.
*   **Smart Help**: Use "Auto-fill with AI" to automatically add a title, notes, tags, and main colors for any picture. It makes organizing super easy!
*   **Different Ways to View**:
    *   **Moodboard**: A classic grid view that adjusts to your screen.
    *   **List**: A compact, detailed list for quick scanning.
    *   **Canvas**: A flexible, zoomable space where you can arrange pictures exactly how you want.
*   **Easy Search**: Quickly find anything you've saved by searching words, tags, or colors.
*   **Your Data, Your Control**: All your saved items are stored on your computer. You can easily save (export) your whole collection to a file and bring it back (import) whenever you need.
*   **Light & Dark Views**: Looks good day or night.
