# LinkBoard - Your Visual Inspiration Hub

LinkBoard is a sleek, responsive, and highly customizable web application designed for creatives, designers, and anyone who needs a personal space to save and organize visual inspiration. Inspired by Pinterest, it allows you to save image links, categorize them into "boards," and arrange them in various layouts, including a freeform canvas.
